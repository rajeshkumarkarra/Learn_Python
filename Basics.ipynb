    "\n",
    "17. except : As explained above, this works together with “try” to catch exceptions.\n",

    "18. raise : Also used for exception handling to explicitly raise exceptions.\n",

    "19. finally : No matter what is result of the “try” block, block termed “finally” is always executed. Detailed article –Exception Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "20. for : This keyword is used to control flow and for looping.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. while : Has a similar working like “for” , used to control flow and for looping.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. pass : It is the null statement in python. Nothing happens when this is encountered. This is used to prevent indentation errors and used as a placeholder\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed Article – for, while, pass\n",
    "\n",
    "23. import : This statement is used to include a particular module into current program.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. from : Generally used with import, from is used to import particular functionality from the module imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. as : This keyword is used to create the alias for the module imported. i.e giving a new name to the imported module.. E.g import math as mymath.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed Article – import, from and as\n",
    "\n",
    "26. lambda : This keyword is used to make inline returning functions with no statements allowed internally. Detailed Article – map, filter, lambda\n",
    "\n",
    "27. return : This keyword is used to return from the function. Detailed article –  Return values in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "28. yield : This keyword is used like return statement but is used to return a generator. Detailed Article – yield keyword\n",

    "29. with : This keyword is used to wrap the execution of block of code within methods defined by context manager.This keyword is not used much in day to day programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "30. in : This keyword is used to check if a container contains a value. This keyword is also used to loop through the container.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A namespace is a system to have a unique name for each and every object in Python. An object might be a variable or a method. Python itself maintains a namespace in the form of a Python dictionary. Let’s go through an example, a directory-file system structure in computers. Needless to say, that one can have multiple directories having a file with the same name inside of every directory. But one can get directed to the file, one wishes, just by specifying the absolute path to the file.\n",
    "Real-time example, the role of a namespace is like a surname. One might not find a single “Alice” in the class there might be multiple “Alice” but when you particularly ask for “Alice Lee” or “Alice Clark” (with a surname), there will be only one (time being don’t think of both first name and surname are same for multiple students).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the similar lines, Python interpreter understands what exact method or variable one is trying to point to in the code, depending upon the namespace. So, the division of the word itself gives little more information. Its Name (which means name, an unique identifier) + Space(which talks something related to scope). Here, a name might be of any Python method or variable and space depends upon the location from where is trying to access a variable or a method.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Types of namespaces :\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python interpreter runs solely without and user-defined modules, methods, classes, etc. Some functions like print(), id() are always present, these are built in namespaces. When a user creates a module, a global namespace gets created, later creation of local functions creates the local namespace. The built-in namespace encompasses global namespace and global namespace encompasses local namespace.\n",
