    "What is namespace:\n",
    "\n",
    "A namespace is a system to have a unique name for each and every object in Python. An object might be a variable or a method. Python itself maintains a namespace in the form of a Python dictionary. Let’s go through an example, a directory-file system structure in computers. Needless to say, that one can have multiple directories having a file with the same name inside of every directory. But one can get directed to the file, one wishes, just by specifying the absolute path to the file.\n",
    "Real-time example, the role of a namespace is like a surname. One might not find a single “Alice” in the class there might be multiple “Alice” but when you particularly ask for “Alice Lee” or “Alice Clark” (with a surname), there will be only one (time being don’t think of both first name and surname are same for multiple students).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the similar lines, Python interpreter understands what exact method or variable one is trying to point to in the code, depending upon the namespace. So, the division of the word itself gives little more information. Its Name (which means name, an unique identifier) + Space(which talks something related to scope). Here, a name might be of any Python method or variable and space depends upon the location from where is trying to access a variable or a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of namespaces :\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python interpreter runs solely without and user-defined modules, methods, classes, etc. Some functions like print(), id() are always present, these are built in namespaces. When a user creates a module, a global namespace gets created, later creation of local functions creates the local namespace. The built-in namespace encompasses global namespace and global namespace encompasses local namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Lifetime of a namespace :\n",
    "\n",
    "A lifetime of a namespace depends upon the scope of objects, if the scope of an object ends, the lifetime of that namespace comes to an end. Hence, it is not possible to access inner namespace’s objects from an outer namespace.\n",

If a block has to be more deeply nested, it is simply indented further to the right. You can understand it better by looking at the following lines of code:"

Comments are the useful information that the developers provide to make the reader understand the source code. It explains the logic or a part of it used in the code. Comments are usually helpful to someone maintaining or enhancing your code when you are no longer around to answer questions about it. These are often cited as a useful programming convention that does not take part in the output of the program but improves the readability of the whole program. There are two types of comment in Python:\n",

If the comment exceeds one line then put a hashtag on the next line and continue the comment.
